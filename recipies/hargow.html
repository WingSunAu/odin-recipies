        At dim sum houses, the server with the steamed crystal shrimp dumplings, commonly known as “xia jiao” or “har
        gow” in Cantonese, is always the most popular person on the floor. I’ll even dare to stick my neck out and claim
        that har gow might be the #1 dim sum item of all time. At least, I wouldn’t be surprised if they were.

        <br>
        Just remember these handy tips, and the rest should be smooth sailing:
        The water MUST be boiling hot when making the dough.
        If the edges of the dough crack as you roll it out, it’s too dry and will be difficult to fold and it will taste
        rubbery
        If you use small shrimp, keep the shrimp whole or cut them in half only. I used large shrimp, so I decided to
        mash them slightly and then coarsely chop them.
