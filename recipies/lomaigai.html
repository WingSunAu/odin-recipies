        Lo mai gai is a classic Cantonese dish which translates to "sticky rice chicken". Legend has it that it was
        first created in the humble night markets of Guangzhou.
        Originally, street vendors used to steam this with a bowl, and then introduced lotus leaves as a more convenient
        to-go option. Not to be confused by joong/zongzi, which traditionally uses bamboo leaves and a variety of other
        fillings, lo mai gai is characterized by its use of glutinous rice and chicken steamed in lotus leaves.
